The Google Toolbox for Mac HTTP Fetcher is a set of classes to simplify http operations in Cocoa applications.

== Basics ==

Because the fetcher is implemented as a wrapper on NSURLConnection, it is asynchronous

At its most basic, the fetcher can be used by adding GTMHTTPFetcher.h/m to your project, and fetching a URL like this:

{{{
  #import "GTMHTTPFetcher.h"
  
  NSURLRequest *request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:myURL];
  GTMHTTPFetcher* myFetcher = [GTMHTTPFetcher fetcherWithRequest:request];
  [myFetcher beginFetchWithDelegate:self
                  didFinishSelector:@selector(myFetcher:finishedWithData:error:)];
}}}

The callback should have a signature string matching
{{{
- (void)myFetcher:(GTMHTTPFetcher *)fetcher finishedWithData:(NSData *)retrievedData error:(NSError *)error;
}}}

Typically, each callback will have a selector named to indicate what was fetched, like
{{{
imageFetcher:finishedWithData:error:

settingsFetcher:finishedWithData:error:
}}}
